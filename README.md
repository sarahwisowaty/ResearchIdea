# Research Topic: U.S. Crime Rates and Types Throughout History

The topic that I would like to work on involves crime rates in the United States. I would like to gather information about crime types and rates per total population of 10 - 20 different major cities. I would like to examine these cities at 3 - 5 different points in time
throughout 1960 to present.

## Context and Existing Research
This idea came to me after perusing various data repositories online. On Kaggle, I found the linked dataset that provides information about U.S. crime rates from 1960 to 2014. This inspired me to further research crime rates past the year of 2014 to present (2023). 
There is a wealth of data available about this online and it would not be difficult to draw comparisons and attain accurate data.

## Possible Research Question(s)
What are the differences between crime rates and types among the major U.S. cities, and have there been major changes in the rates and types of crimes throughout the past 70 years? Can the differences be explained, and how?

## Exploring the Topic
In order to explore the topic, I will need to gather data about the various cities. This will need to come after the initial research stage, because the type of data I need to gather on cities will be flexible depending on my findings. I will definitely need to gather some
census data in order to establish general information about the population of a city - this is important when conducting research about the actions of that particular population. I may need to gather other information - for example, if I find that the mugging rate is highest
in New York for 10 straight years above all other cities, I may need to gather data on subway security and if the rate stayed constant or decreased after hiring more, number of citizens per police officer at the time, etc. I should read articles and reports that highlight
major crime-related statistical occurrences - they may help me to locate and gather data on anomalies.

## What kind of data?
Crime rates per a select number of the population, the leading types of crimes committed in each city, police reports, census reports, poverty and homelessness rates, and more may become relevant throughout my research.

## Tools and Methods
Python can possibly be used to scrape and count the top crime - related words from crime reports.
